# scroll-slide
Navigation method where sections slide up

Each panel has a width of 100% and a height of 100vh

I like to think of it like a stack of cards.

When you scroll down, the card nearest the top is moved up 100vh

Controls keep track of what panel you are on 

Clicking controls will take you straight to the desired panel
